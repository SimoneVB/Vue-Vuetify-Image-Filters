# Vue/Vuetify ImageFilters
A demo Vue/Vuetify APP to apply Image effects using CSS filters

![cover](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*M0BncfU1BlAvXX_FOoXn3g.webp)

I was developing a mobile APP for a professional photographer, who is to use it to sell his photos. The APP looks like a kind of gallery, where the user browses through the photos; applies filters to them; puts them in the shopping cart and completes the purchase; and then goes to the studio to pick up his prints.
In addition to applying filters, I was asked to come up with something to prevent users from getting the photos for free-perhaps with simple screen-shots.

For demonstration purposes, here I will create a simple Vue3/Vuetify application with the functionality described above.
But it should be mentioned that these filters require simple HTML+CSS. So, they can be used in any Web/Mobile App.
